## Romans as Construction Worker
- *I really dig learning about history. In these travels I learned about how Romans soldiers were more skill-wise than cats that will kill you. They were skilled in many of the areas needed to move (and build) across large territories (Dan Carlin). Collapsing all of these skills into one person with a known shared objective is a powerful notion of consolidation. It forced reconciling the notion of generalism and specialization; a consolodation of both skills and purpose taht seems quite familiar in the modern context. To save on complexity and costs, as a pattern, we abstract away and miniturize our hard to operate constructs. It may be DC consolidation in the 2000s or assiliation and cooptation of DevOps toolchains/skill bredth using 'Agile' System Administration practices and and core engineering priciples.*


- Being an imperial power requires this kind of agility and allignments across proxies to be effective
